## Intent of publication

For people who wish to contribute their own subtitle additions from third-party mods when applicable and supply them with translations. They should view the formatting index available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aPCZAgUGpQImp0_3_iA5Hmn1qqhBic0NFWg37GEwZZM/edit#gid=863928449 and use that as a concept bible for their own works.

## How to use this Script

Modify as deemed fit for task `prefixes.json` and run the application as defined above. It really is that simple. Once finished, perform any additional formatting necessary and create a merge request.

**Please** do not commit issues asking me how to use the software on Microsoft Windows, I have no idea â€” I used this software on an open-source OS and it worked just fine for me.
